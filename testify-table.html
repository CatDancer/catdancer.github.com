>Treat tables like functions in Arc's list sequence functions</i
></p

>Arc comes with a number of functions that apply a function to successive elements of a sequence.  From the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt"
>Arc tutorial</a
>:</p
><blockquote
><pre
>
  arc&#62; (keep odd '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
  (1 3 5 7)
  arc&#62; (rem odd '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
  (2 4 6)
  arc&#62; (all odd '(1 3 5 7))
  t
  arc&#62; (some even '(1 3 5 7))
  nil
  arc&#62; (pos even '(1 2 3 4 5))
  1
</pre
></blockquote
><p
>If the first argument isn’t a function, it is treated like a function that tests for equality with that (again, from the Arc tutorial):</p
><blockquote
><pre
>
  arc&#62; (rem 'a '(a b a c u s))
  (b c u s)
</pre
></blockquote
><p
>Since a table isn’t a function, if you pass it as the first argument, it gets treated as a value to test for equality with.</p
><p
>This patch changes Arc so that tables are instead treated like functions are:</p
><blockquote
><pre
>
  arc&#62; (rem (obj a t c t) '(a b a c u s))
  (b u s)
</pre
></blockquote
><p
>In arc2 this evaluates to <code>'(a b a c u s)</code>, since none of the elements of the list is the table.  Of course, this means you can no longer check for a table in a list of tables without resorting to writing your own function to check for equality:</p
><blockquote
><pre
>
  arc&#62; (with (t1 (obj a 1) t2 (obj a 2) t3 (obj a 3))
         (rem t2 (list t1 t2 t3)))
  (#hash((a . 1)) #hash((a . 3)))                 &#60;--- arc2
  (#hash((a . 1)) #hash((a . 2)) #hash((a . 3)))  &#60;--- with this patch
</pre

>&ldquo;<code>patch</code>&rdquo; is a standard utility that comes with Unix.  (If you&rsquo;re running Windows, iirc <code>patch</code> comes with cygwin).</p

>For example,</p
><blockquote

 $ tar xf arc2.tar
 $ cd arc2
 $ patch &#60;arc2.testify-table0.patch

>In a repository where arc2 has been checked in as a different commit, running git-merge will produce merge conflicts as it tries to apply both of the arc2 commits.  See the instructions at the end of <a href="sharing-hacks.html"
