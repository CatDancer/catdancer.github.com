><code>arc2</code> writes Arc lists by converting them to Scheme lists and printing them using the Scheme writer.  By implementing a writer for Arc values we can build upon this patch to customize the output of Arc values.  The <a href="table-reader-writer.html"
>table-reader-writer</a
> patch does this for Arc tables.</p
><p
>By itself this patch is supposed to produce the same output as <code>arc2</code> does.  (If it doesn’t, that would be a bug).</p

>Apply This Hack to Your Arc</h2
><p
>By using patch or git, you can incorporate this patch into your version of Arc.</p
><h3
>With patch</h3
><p
>To apply this patch to your copy of arc using the patch command, download <a href="http://catdancer.github.com/arc2.list-writer0.patch"
>arc2.list-writer0.patch</a
> into your Arc directory, and at the Unix command line inside the Arc directory, type:</p
><blockquote
><pre
> patch &#60;arc2.list-writer0.patch</pre
></blockquote
><p
>&ldquo;<code>patch</code>&rdquo; is a standard utility that comes with Unix.  (If you&rsquo;re running Windows, iirc <code>patch</code> comes with cygwin).</p
><p
>For example,</p
><blockquote
><pre
> $ wget http://ycombinator.com/arc/arc2.tar
 [... downloading ...]
 $ tar xf arc2.tar
 $ cd arc2
 $ patch &#60;arc2.list-writer0.patch
 patching [...]
 $</pre
></blockquote
><h3
>With git</h3
><p
>In a git repository that has the same arc2 ancestor commit as mine, git-merge can be used:</p
><blockquote
><pre
>$ git merge arc2.list-writer0</pre
></blockquote
><p
>In a repository where arc2 has been checked in as a different commit, running git-merge will produce merge conflicts as it tries to apply both of the arc2 commits.  See the instructions at the end of <a href="sharing-hacks.html"
>Sharing Hacks</a
> for how to resolve the conflict.</p
